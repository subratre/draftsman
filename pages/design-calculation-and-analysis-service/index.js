                Design calculations for structures involve a systematic process
                to determine the appropriate size, strength, and configuration
                of structural elements based on the applied loads and other
                relevant factors. The following steps are typically involved in
                the design calculation process for structures:

                structural engineers, who use their expertise and specialized
